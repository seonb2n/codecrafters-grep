This is a starting point for Go solutions to the
["Build Your Own grep" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/grep/overview).

[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
(Regexes, for short) are patterns used to match character combinations in
strings. [`grep`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) is a CLI tool for
searching using Regexes.

In this challenge you'll build your own implementation of `grep`. Along the way
we'll learn about Regex syntax, how parsers/lexers work, and how regular
expressions are evaluated.
